I am an Assistant Professor (Tenure Track) at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University Singapore (NTU). My research focus on method development for multi-omics data integration and its application to precision medicine. I am looking for highly motivated postdocs and students to join my lab. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested (xiaotao.shen@ntu.edu.sg). The Shen Lab website is here: https://www.shen-lab.org/.

 My overarching research interests are bioinformatics algorithms development for multi-omics data, and their application to precision medicine. Specifically, I am interested in bioinformatics algorithm development, including:

1. Comprehensive analysis workflow and deep learning for LC-MS data, 

2. Metabolic network analysis, 

3. Wearable and multi-omics data integration,

4. microbiome and metabolome data integration. 
 
I also employed the developed bioinformatics algorithms as a unique systems biology approach to study the potential biomarkers and mechanisms of 1) pregnancy and related diseases, 2) aging and related diseases, and 3) cancer. 
More tools and projects I developed can be found in the [Projects](#projects) part.
