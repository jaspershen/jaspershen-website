title: Generalized reporter score-based enrichment analysis for omics data

abstract: Enrichment analysis contextualizes biological features in pathways to facilitate a systematic understanding of high-dimensional data and is widely used in biomedical research. The emerging reporter score-based analysis (RSA) method shows more promising sensitivity, as it relies on P-values instead of raw values of features. However, RSA cannot be directly applied to multi-group and longitudinal experimental designs and is often misused due to the lack of a proper tool. Here, we propose the Generalized Reporter Score-based Analysis (GRSA) method for multi-group and longitudinal omics data. A comparison with other popular enrichment analysis methods demonstrated that GRSA had increased sensitivity across multiple benchmark datasets. We applied GRSA to microbiome, transcriptome and metabolome data and discovered new biological insights in omics studies. Finally, we demonstrated the application of GRSA beyond functional enrichment using a taxonomy database. We implemented GRSA in an R package, ReporterScore, integrating with a powerful visualization module and updatable pathway databases, which is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ReporterScore). We believe that the ReporterScore package will be a valuable asset for broad biomedical research fields.
