title: Serum metabolomics for early diagnosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by UHPLC-QTOF/MS

abstract: "Introduction Previous metabolomics studies have revealed perturbed metabolic signatures in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients, however, most of these studies included mainly late-staged ESCC patients due to the difficulties of collecting the early-staged samples from asymptotic ESCC subjects.
Objectives This study aims to explore the early-staged ESCC metabolic signatures and potential of serum metabolomics to diagnose ESCC at early stages. Methods Serum samples of 97 ESCC patients (stage 0, 39 cases; stage I, 17 cases; stage II, 11 cases, stage III, 30 cases) and 105 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled and randomly separated into training data (77 ESCCs, 84 HCs) and validation data (20 ESCCs, 21 HCs). Untargeted metabolomics was performed to identify ESCC-related metabolic …"
